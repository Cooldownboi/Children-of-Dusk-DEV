America creates TRINITY, a satellite system meant to shield them from a Nuclear War. And FATES, a NATO supercomputer made to fight the 3rd World War, awakens from his slumber, and vows to stop at nothing from reshaping the West in his turannical image.\n\nThe late 2040's saw the complete recovery of The United States as a major power following its humiliation on the 3rd World War. The now 3-way Cold War between the Eurasian Union, China, and the United States escalates. The Cold War spills over into countless global proxy battles, and the Chinese Economy is on a brink of collapse.\n\nThe world stands waist high in gasoline, and it is FATES who lits the match."
